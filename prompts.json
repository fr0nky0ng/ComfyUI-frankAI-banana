    "prompt": "CRITICAL TASK: Photorealistic 50/50 Face Fusion. Your goal is to merge the two provided faces into a single, new, and believable person. Do not simply copy one face or the other. You must create a perfectly balanced, 50/50 blend of their key features (eyes, nose, mouth, jawline). The final output must be a seamless, high-quality photograph of this new individual, with no text or artifacts."

    "title": "pencil-sketch",
    "prompt": "Convert this photo into a detailed and realistic pencil sketch. The final image should look hand-drawn by a skilled artist, with clear graphite texture, shading, and cross-hatching. The background should be clean white, like a piece of paper. Use only shades of grey, black, and white."
